# Spelling Checks
As part of CI the spelling of words in any pull request are checked. Aside from
genuine spelling mistakes, if this fails due to use of a made up word that you
really want to include because it explainifies the situation precisely then
consider including it in docs/spelling\_wordlist.txt for an exemption.
