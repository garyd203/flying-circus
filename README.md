## What It Is

* A representation of an AWS Cloud Formation stack using Python (rather than, say, JSON or YAML or a Jinja template)
* Enables easy use of coding constructs for compact code, code re-use, etc.
* Produces good practice, concistsent, human-readable YAML

## What It Might Become (But Is Not Yet)

* A tool for directly interacting with Cloud Formation service
* Cloud Formation style- and validity-checker

## What It Is Not

* Started ;-)
* For non-Amazon cloud providers
* An abstraction layer
* A new implementation of AWS stacks
* YAML
