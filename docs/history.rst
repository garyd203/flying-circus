History of Flying Circus
========================

A potted history of the project

Where Did The Name Come From?
-----------------------------

Name ideas
• NB: All the good names are already taken on pypi.
• A high level type of cloud, like cirrus
• Some dramatic powerful cloud-related idea, like thunder storm.
• Thor. He controls clouds.
• Zeus. God of the clouds, etc
• Some God or cloud allusion from Monty python
*(flying circus). Allusion to Monty python. Allusion to ww1 German fighter "formation".  Mis spelling of cirrus

## What's With The Name

Good question!
Flying Circus is primarily a reference to the Monty Python TV show, since
Monty Python references are expected behaviour in the Python community.
Additionally, during World War 1 the German fighter units organised themselves
into large units of colourful planes, the most famous of which was
called a Flying Circus [wikipedia]. The imagery of lots of diverse things
working together was strking

Oh, and all the good cloud-related names were already in use.
