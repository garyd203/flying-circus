Principles:

* complete one-for-one mapping for classes in the raw package - just a straight python representation, same names, same everything
* UPdated classes in the serivice package, with minor behaviour tweaked for good result
* factory functions for concrete scenarios, with pythinoic naming (snake-cased function names and parameter names)s
