What?
====
Flying Circus uses the LGPL. This is a copy-left open source licence intended for
libraries that are used by other, non-open-source, projects.

The expectation is that if you modify Flying Circus (eg. fix a bug in the core components, or update
the mappings to Amazon services) then you will make those improvements available to the broader
community, ideally via a Pull Request on GitHub. When you use Flying Circus to define your
AWS infrastructure as a separate project or Python module, then that Python code
remains your own, and you can do with it what you want. However, do note that IANAL :-)

Why?
====

The open source community nowadays is great, and truly is greater than the sum of it's parts.
So much modern software is built on the shoulders of giants, our predecessors and peers who
have created powerful software for us to use. But there's always selfish people who take advantage of the rest of us,
and don't want to help make the whole greater. A GPL-style licence provides a degree of legal protection to force the bad actors
to do the right thing, whilst not inconveniencing the rest of us. The LGPL variant, in particular, allows us to
retain IP ownership and secrecy for our internal infrastructure, whilst still using the power of Flying Circus.

consider a different licence for the doco (eg. Creative Commons)
