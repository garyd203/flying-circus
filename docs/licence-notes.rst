What?
====

Flying Circus uses the LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public Licence). This is a
copy-left open source licence intended for libraries that are used by other,
non-open-source, projects.

The expectation is that if you modify Flying Circus itself (eg. fix a bug in
the core components, or update the mappings to Amazon Web Services) then you
will make those improvements available to the broader community, ideally via
a Pull Request on GitHub. When you use Flying Circus to define your AWS
infrastructure as a separate project or Python module, then that Python code
and any generated artefacts (like Cloud Formation YAML) remains your own,
which you can do with as you please. However, do note that IANAL :-)

Why?
====

The open source community nowadays is a fantastic example of something that is greater than the sum of it's parts.
So much modern software is built on the shoulders of giants, our predecessors and peers who
have created powerful software for us to use. But there's always (selfish people|bad actors) who take advantage of the rest of us,
and don't want to help make the whole greater. A GPL-style licence provides a degree of legal protection to force the bad actors
to do the right thing, whilst not inconveniencing the rest of us. The LGPL variant, in particular, allows users to
retain IP ownership and secrecy for our internal infrastructure, whilst still using the power of Flying Circus.
