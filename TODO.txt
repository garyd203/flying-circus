Classes we need

- Base class to represent an AWS CFN resource, plus other low level primitives
- Base classes to represent all AWS services as resources, with well-defined fields. A bug-for-bug pass-through implementation of existing functionality, complete with quirky names
- Library of best practice default implementations of all services
- Library of good practice implementations of common multi-service patterns
- Multiple (internal) libraries of localised services
- Concrete stacks built on top of the library classes

Other cross cutting programmatic constructs

- Export to YAML
- Interact with CFN directly
- Extra naming layer that is consistent across services and pythonic
- CFN linter at instance creation time

Programming Standards

- Well tested
- Based off boto3, perhaps
- Clear doco
- Python 2 & 3
- Allow full access to underlying CFN
- Easy exit strategy to go back to YAML
